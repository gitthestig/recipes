#Real Home Made Crepes#

Crepes the way I was taught as a kid in France. No fancy excentric stuff.

* 250g of flour
* 5 eggs
* 1 Beer
* 1 cup of milk
* 1 pinch of salt
* 1 spoon of oil

##INSTRUCTIONS##

1. Mix the Flour, eggs, and milk until you have a consistent mix.

2. Add the salt and oil to the mix.

3. Add the beer slowly and mix calmly.

4. Leave the mix in the fridge for 3 hours

5. Heat a pan, put some oil and extend it with a napkin.

6. When heated place enough of the mix to extend it and have a thin layer.

7. Shake the pan, if the layer comes off easy then flip and wait 30 seconds.

8. Serve and add nutlla and/or bannana and/or sugar, etc.
